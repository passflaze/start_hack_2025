# DesertAfrication - StartHack Project 2025

## Overview
Our goal was to develop an interactive dashboard mapping each pixel to a specific geographical coordinate comprising all the relevant info regarding the evolution of that specific piece of soil throughout the years. 
We managed to create a dataset of +2M data including both the data extracted from the metadata given by the case partners (geo maps) and the data fetched via NASA API. 
Due to computing and API answer time, we had to split the entire map by grid squares, trying not to miss any relevant information.
Eventually, we performed a statistical analysis of the whole dataset and some machine learnign algorithms to isolate causal correlations, past, present & future trends, understand which portion of the land were more affected by the desertification and trying to propose the best solution to the problem. 

We proposed, supported by numerous scientific papers and reports from similar past projects, the development of an infrastructure of solar panels to harness the region's abundant solar energy. This initiative would be backed by a careful selection of private stakeholders, with restrictions ensuring that a significant portion of any eventual income and success would be shared with the local population, in order to improve the region's socio-economic conditions.

Unfortunately, we didnt' manage to create the database, due to lacking frontend-wise skills, and due to mismanagement of time. 

One thing for sure : we learnt a lot ;)
